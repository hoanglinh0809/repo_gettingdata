HOW TO RUN

1. Copy the R script run_analysis.R into folder UCI HAR Dataset
2. Run the script to produce 2 output files:
   a. tidy_data.csv : first tidy data to include all the data (subjectID, activity, activity name, other variables)
   b. tidy_data2.csv : second tidy data to include all the data (subjectID, activity, activity name, average of other variables)
   
3. The variables name is self-explanatory, so there is no need for code book, :)
